## Getting Started

This project is a simple weather app using Flutter and NodeJS

### Backend 
You don't need to run the backend, and it's hosted [onRender](https://simpleweatherappbackend.onrender.com/api/weather/),
And it implements two endpoints from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/):

for the front end you should have either a virtual emulator for andorid or your mobile phone with the USB debugging feature enabled.

you should have installed flutter and dart.
